# Eventure
  
## Overview

**"Eventure"** is an Android application developed as part of the **Mobile Applications** course at the **Faculty of Technical Sciences, Novi Sad**. It was created by a team of four students using **Java** and **XML** in **Android Studio**, with **Firebase** serving as the database.  The app provides an intuitive platform for event organization and management.  The full specification is available [**here**](https://github.com/MiljanaMa/Eventure/blob/main/specification/Eventure_Specification_English.pdf). The class diagram is available [**here**](https://github.com/MiljanaMa/Eventure/blob/main/class-diagram/eventure-class-diagram.png).

## User Roles

The system supports four types of users:  
- **Event Organizers** – Plan and manage events.  
- **Product & Service Providers - Owners** – Offer products and services for events.  
- **Product & Service Providers - Employees** – Assist in event execution.  
- **Administrators** – Oversee and manage the platform.

## My Tasks

My tasks involved handling the login and registration process, managing the admin screens for categories, subcategories, event types, and subcategory suggestions. I also implemented product purchase and service reservation functionality. Additionally, I integrated a notification feature and developed the app's navigation system.
